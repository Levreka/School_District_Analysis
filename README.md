# School_District_AnalysisPurpose of Analysis:
The purpose after being informed by Maria that her supervisor has found evidence of academic dishonesty in reading and math in Thomas High School 9th graders. We have to reevaluate our code and edit lines or remove lines of codes that no longer applied in order to remove the data of 9th Graders scores from Thomas High school. To replace those scores we used the Nans entries and proceed to analyzing again the data from PyCitySchools

Results:
•	How is the district summary affected?
•	School District Summary shows that by excluding the 9th graders math and reading scores from Thomas Highschool. Slightly affects the over all tenth of average scores in both math and reading. The slight decrease hardly affected the total count but it does affect school summary
•	 
•	How is the school summary affected
•	 By the image above we can see the total schools average scores is affected by almost 3 percent on both reading and math test scores, the change is not as drastic as originally expected and it can be misleading due to the fact of the percentage was an increase rather than decrease. It can lead others speculate the schools are averaging better scores.
•	How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
